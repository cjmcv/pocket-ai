# engine/vk

A small computing framework based on vulkan. 

This framework is designed to help you quickly call vulkan's computing API to do the calculations you need.

## Depends

* Install the graphics card driver；
* Install the [vulkan sdk](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)；

## How to use

* Refer to example/vk/vk_engine_example.cpp && example/vk/CMakeLists.txt

## Reference

### Compute shaders

Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.

Compute shaders in Vulkan have first class support in the API. Compute shaders give applications the ability to perform non-graphics related tasks on the GPU.
